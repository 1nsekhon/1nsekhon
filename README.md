## Hi there, I am Nanki! üëã

I am an Full Stack Engineer originally from the Bay Area and currently based in Los Angeles, California. In 2023, I graduated with a BS in Computer Engineering & Computer Science from Santa Clara University. I recieved my AWS Certification in Cloud Computing in May 2025.

I am currently working at a Multinational Industrial Tech Company called AVEVA as a Software Engineer. I have helped build its full stack web applictaion for InTouch using C++/C#, Telerik, and the .NET framework. 

In my free time, I work on advancing my other technical skills. I am currently building out Touch Grass and Kupra, my own mobile applications. Additionally, I am getting my AWS Associate Certification in being a Solutions Architect.
